## What Causes Black Textures in Fallout New Vegas?
 
Black textures or flickering graphics in Fallout New Vegas can be caused by several factors, such as:
 
- Too many or too large texture files. The game engine has a limit on how many textures it can load at once, and if you exceed that limit, it may fail to render some of them properly.
- Outdated or incompatible graphics drivers. Some drivers may have bugs or conflicts with the game that can affect its performance and appearance.
- Incorrect archive invalidation settings. Archive invalidation is a feature that allows the game to use custom textures instead of the original ones. However, if it is not enabled or configured correctly, it may cause some textures to be missing or corrupted.

## How to Fix Black Textures in Fallout New Vegas?
 
Depending on the cause of your problem, you may need to try different methods to fix black textures in Fallout New Vegas. Here are some possible solutions that you can try:

1. Reduce the size and amount of texture files. If you are using texture mods such as NMC's, you may want to use a lower resolution version or a tool that can compress them. For example, you can use [DDSopt](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46074/) to reduce the size of your texture files without losing much quality. You can also uninstall some texture mods that you don't need or use.
2. Update or revert your graphics drivers. If you are using Nvidia or AMD graphics cards, you may want to check if there are any updates or rollbacks available for your drivers. Some drivers may have issues with Fallout New Vegas that can cause black textures or flickering graphics. For example, some users reported that the Nvidia driver version 372.54 caused problems with the game and reverting to an older version fixed them.
3. Enable and configure archive invalidation. If you are using a mod manager such as Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer, you may need to toggle archive invalidation on and off whenever you install new texture mods. This will ensure that the game uses the custom textures instead of the original ones. You can also use a tool such as [ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated!](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35935/) to enable archive invalidation automatically.

## Conclusion
 
Fallout New Vegas is a great game that can be enhanced by using texture mods. However, sometimes these mods can cause black textures or flickering graphics that can ruin your experience. To fix this problem, you may need to reduce the size and amount of texture files, update or revert your graphics drivers, or enable and configure archive invalidation. Hopefully, these methods will help you enjoy Fallout New Vegas without any graphical glitches.
